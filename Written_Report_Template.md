## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	- The most amount of successful movies came in May.
	- The least amount of successful movies came during the winter, when also the most amount of failed movies came in.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	- The smaller the goal, the more successful movies there were.
	- The higher the goal, the more cancelled and failed movies.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	- The sample does not fully represent the population of Kickstarter campaigns. Only a third or so of campaigns make it through funding \n
	but this database had more than half as successful.
	- Sample includes a lot of theatre campaigns but theatre is not a very common category on kickstarter.
	- Not a lot of metrics describing success of the categories during the covered time period
	- Dataset does not include what donors receive in exchange for their donations.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	- A table showing the most successful categories vs the most unsuccessful categories
	- Some sort of graph that further breaks down each category in order to find out what makes different organizations in the same industry successful.
